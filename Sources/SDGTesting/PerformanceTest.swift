/// Tests that a closure executes within a specified amount of time.
///
/// The closure will be run several times to determine the mean duration. If the mean duration is slower than the expected time, the test will fail. If the mean duration is within the expected time, then the test will pass and the mean duration will be printed.
///
/// Notes: A closure’s execution times may vary vastly accross different systems or build configurations. Expectations must either be set according to the slowest environment where the tests will be run, or else limited by conditions so as to only run on those environments that are meaningful.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - testName: A name to identify the particular test in the output.
///   - duration: The time limit within which the closure is expected to complete.
///   - file: The file name where the call occurs. Provided.
///   - line: The line number where the call occurs. Provided.
///   - test: The closure to test.
